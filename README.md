## KMeans__clustering

## Project Title :
Analysis and Prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of phonix small to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop. On the basis of this prediction of annual income vs spending scores.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The american finance market as per the GDP of 2011,'phoniex_tryllums' as in the first range in the out of file.The owner wants to be exact which particular shop or a products. Search in different type of clusters in entire mall
As a data science engineer predict the futuristic financial market per up[coming GDP ray.Based on number of clusters
The client want atleast top 5 clusters-SHOP

## CONCLUSION
According to the model basics predictoin using machine learning "KM" "k is clustering". 
We found that "cluster 1" which consists red is highest cluster,Which attach more than 50 datanodes.

## REFERENCES:
The model building algorithm devlop for all kinds of clusteration values.The "yellow spot represent CENTROID".
